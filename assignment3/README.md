# Assignment 3. Modifying and rewriting software
## Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package
Keep a log in the file lab3.txt of what you do in the lab so that you can reproduce the results later. This should not merely be a transcript of what you typed: it should be more like a true lab notebook, in which you briefly note down what you did and what happened.

You're helping to build an application containing a shell script that invokes the ls command to get file status. Your application is running atop the Maroon Chapeau Enterprise Linux 8 distribution, which uses the ls implementation supplied by Coreutils 8.29. You've been running into the problem that some users create a shell script la with the following contents:

#!/bin/sh
exec ls -a "$@"
For these users the command la -A is therefore equivalent to ls -a -A. Unfortunately, with Coreutils ls, the -a option always overrides the -A option regardless of which option is given first, so the -A option has no effect in la. For example, if the current directory has two files named .foo and bar, the command la -A outputs four lines, one each for ., .., .foo, and bar. These users want la -A to output just two lines instead, one for .foo and one for bar. That is, for ls they want a later -A option to override any earlier -a option, and vice versa.

You've been asked to look into the problem and fix it.

You discover that the problem is a known bug with Coreutils, Bug#30963. The bug report has a patch intended for publication in a later Coreutils release; see its Message #10. You don't want to wait for the later release to be installed on your system, so you decide to build a copy of Coreutils 8.29 with just this patch added, as follows:

1. Grab the Coreutils 8.29 source code compressed tarball and verify its signature with the GNU keyring by running the shell command gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig in your directory. Note any problems with this verification, and briefly explain why they happen.
2. Compile and install your copy of Coreutils into a temporary directory of your own. Note any problems you run into.
3. Reproduce the bug on your machine with the unmodified version of coreutils.
4. Apply the patch of Bug#30963 Message #10.
5. Type the command make at the top level of your source tree, so that you build (but do not install) the fixed version. For each command that gets executed, explain why it needed to be executed (or say that it wasn't neeeded).
6. Make sure your change fixes the bug, by testing that the modified ls works and that the installed ls doesn't. Use the test case that comes with the patch.

Q1. Does the patch improve the performance of ls or make it worse? Briefly explain.

Q2. If your company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead of the default one, what else should you watch out for? Might this new version of Coreutils introduce other problems with your application?

## Homework: Rewriting a script
Consider the Python script randline.py.

Q3. What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, and why?

Q4. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by using the command python3 instead of python.)

Write a new script shuf.py in the style of randline.py; your script should implement the GNU shuf command that is part of GNU Coreutils. You should already have a copy of the shuf source code and documentation; look at the files you created in the laboratory. However, GNU shuf is written in C, whereas you want a Python implementation so that you can more easily add new features to it.

Your implementation should support the following shuf options, with the same behavior as GNU shuf: --echo (-e), --head-count (-n), --repeat (-r), and --help. It should also support any number (including zero) of non-option arguments, as well as the argument "-" meaning standard input. Your program need not support the other options of GNU shuf. As with GNU shuf, your program should report an error if given invalid arguments.

Your implementation of shuf.py should not import any modules other than argparse, string and the modules that randline.py already imports. Don't forget to change its usage message to accurately describe the modified behavior.

Port your shuf.py implementation to Python 3. If you have trouble with optparse under Python 3, you can use the argparse module instead. Make sure that your shuf.py still works with Python 2. Don't rewrite it from scratch; make as few changes as is reasonable.
