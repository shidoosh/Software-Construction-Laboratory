I used lnxsrv07 on a remote seas net machine to answer the following questions. 


1. What shell command uses the man program to print all the commands 
that have a specific word in their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? (hint: man man)

The shell command apropos.
In options section of man (using man man to see):
   $ man man 
	…in OPTIONS…
-k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short  manual  page  descrip‐
              tions  for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for
              details.
So I checked the See Also section of man and apropos was there too. 
Using man apropos, under description section: 
   $ man apropos
       Each manual page has a short description available within it.   apropos
       searches the descriptions for instances of keyword.

2. Where are the cp and wc programs located in the file system? 
List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
   $ whereis cp
	/usr/local/cs/bin/cp 
   $ whereis wc 
	/usr/local/cs/bin/wc 

3. What executable programs have names that are just one character long, and what do they do?
 List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
   $ find /usr/bin -name '?' -executable
	/usr/bin/[
	/usr/bin/w
	/usr/bin/X

   $ man w
       w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
   $ man X
	Nothing showed up. So I tried wh.. commands. 
   $ whatis X
	Still nothing. Tried using the older server lnxsrv02, and ran man X again. 
   $ man X
	X - a portable, network-transparent window system
     The problem was that X was a symbolic link to Xorg. man Xorg on lnxsrv07 produced same result as man X on lnxsrv02.
   $ man [ 
	Specifies a bash built-in command, used for conditional flow, 
        considering the commands listed in the description (true, false, break, continue, exit). 

4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, 
which file actually is executed? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
   $ readlink /usr/bin/emacs		a symbolic link
	/etc/alternatives/emacs 
   $ readlink /etc/alternatives/emacs	also a symbolic link
        /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
   $ readlink /usr/bin/emacs-24.3          real file. 
	
		/usr/bin/emacs executes /etc/alternatives/emacs which executes /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 . 

5. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. 
What does the symbolic mode g+s,o-x mean, in terms of permissions?
$ man chmod
	…In DESCRIPTION…
	g: the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's  group  
	+: causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file  mode  bits  of  each  file
	s: set user or group ID on execution 
	o: other users not in file’s group or owners 
	-: causes selected mode bits to be removed
	x: execute  (or  search  for directories)  

	So, 
		g+s: set ID of the group of users granted permission on file 
		o-x: remove permissions for the members specified by o option. 


6. What option to find lets you search for files that have been modified in the last three weeks?
   $ man find 
	…In EXPRESSIONS…
	…In OPTIONS…
   -mtime n
              File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.  See the comments  for  -atime  to  understand  how 
              rounding affects the interpretation of file modification times.

   	So, to find files last modified in last weeks, n = 21, with - (to find WITHIN last 21*24 hours). 

7. Use the previous answer to find all directories modified in the last three weeks. 
List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
	…In home directory… 
   $ find . -type d -mtime -21
./Desktop
./Desktop/$RECYCLE.BIN
./Documents
./Documents/$RECYCLE.BIN
./Downloads
./Downloads/$RECYCLE.BIN
./.cache/abrt
8. Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic links? 
List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
246 symbolic links. 
$ whereis find 
	find: /usr/bin/find /usr/share/man/man1/find.1.gz /usr/share/man/	man1p/find.1p.gz

9. What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib directory? Use the last-modified time to determine age. 
Include files (with names starting with ".") in your search. List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
The only way I know how to show a hidden file (ones that start with ‘.’) is with -a option of ls.
 To find out last-modified file using ls: 
   $ man ls
…In DESCRIPTION…
-t     sort by modification time, newest first
-u     with  -lt:  sort  by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by
              access time
$ cd /usr/lib
$ ls -a  -l -t
Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0 is the oldest file. 

10. Where does the locale command get its data from? 
List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
Locale gets it’s data from environmental variables that controls the locale. 
   $ man locale
	…In DESCRIPTION…
        locale  displays  the  current  locale  settings for each locale category (see locale(5)), 
        based on the settings of the environment variables that control the locale  (see  locale(7))

11. In Emacs, what commands have sort in their name? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.
   $ emacs
   $ C-h 
   $ a
   $ sort
   $ Enter
Buffer-menu-sort              
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns                 
   Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields                
   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
   line.
sort-lines              
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-numeric-fields     
   Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages      
   Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-paragraphs          
   Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-regexp-fields        
   Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort      
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort     
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-a through C-M-h do? 
Can you list their actions concisely? 
List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.
   $ emacs
Emacs Commands:
C-h r
Enter on Key Index
* C-M-a:                                 Move to beginning of current or preceding defun
* C-M-b:                                 Move backward over a balanced expression (backward-sexp). 
* C-M-c:                                 Exiting the recursive edit
* C-M-d:                                 Move down in parenthesis structure (down-list).
* C-M-d (Dired):                         Go down in the directory tree, to the first subdirectory's header line (dired-tree-down).
* C-M-e:                                 Move to end of current or following defun (end-of-defun). 
* C-M-f:                                 Move forward over a balanced expression (forward-sexp). 
* C-M-f (Rmail):                         Makes a partial summary that mentions only the messages whose ‘From’ fields match the 											regular expression senders. (rmail-summary-by-senders) 
* C-M-h:                                 Put region around whole current or following defun (mark-defun).

Curiously, C-M-g wasn’t listed. 
So, by inspection by entering C-M-g, emacs outputted “quit.” Thus, C-M-g is a quit command. 

13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do? 
List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.
	$ emacs
	C-h r
	Enter on Key Index
	Enter on C-g
	* C-g:      Quit: cancel running or partially typed command.

14. What does the Emacs yank function do? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.
	$ emacs
	C-h r
	Enter on Key Index 
	Enter on C-y
	* C-y:                                   Yanking
	Yank the last kill into the buffer, at point (yank).
	Yanking essentially pastes texts that was killed (cut) prior. 
        In other words, it pastes what is in the kill region (M-w). 

15. When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, 
and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command? 
List any shell or Emacs commands you used to answer this question.
cd /usr/bin
ls -l 
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       41496 Jun 30  2016 [
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root      107856 Mar  2  2017 a2p

-rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       11224 May 30  2017 abrt-action-analyze-oops
……and so on.

$ emacs
C-x d 
dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       69632 Dec 28 13:15 .
  drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 Nov 18  2016 ..

  -rwxr-xr-x    1 root root       11224 May 30  2017 abrt-action-analyze-oops
……and so on. 	
	Using dired, 2 more files are printed relative to the ls -l: 
		dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       69632 Dec 28 13:15 .
  		drwxr-xr-x.  15 root root        4096 Nov 18  2016 ..

	These files are hidden, as indicated with them starting with a ‘.’. 
	Considering this, the Emacs dired command is equivalent to the linux shell command ls -l -a. 
	Thus, the difference the Emacs dired command shows all files, even hidden ones, whereas ls -l (hence, with no -a option) does not.
