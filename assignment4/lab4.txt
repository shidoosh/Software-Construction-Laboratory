To download patch
	$ wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter18/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
To build with patch
	$ patch -p0 < coreutils.diff 
Now, we can do make, make install
	$ make
	$ make install

Q: What problems did you have when building it as-is, 
and why did the renaming patch fix them?
	The patch renamed functions that were causing conflicting types (futimens). 
	The renaming patch changed the names of these functions by prepending "coreutils_"
	to distinguish them, thus fixing the compilation error. 
To reproduce the problem
	$ vim reproduceBug.sh
	in reproduceBug.sh:
		#!/bin/bash
		tmp=$(mktemp -d)
		cd $tmp
		touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
		touch now
		sleep 1
		touch now1
		TZ=UTC0 /u/eng/class/classesh/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
		cd/u/eng/class/classesh/coreutils-with-bug
		rm -fr $tmp
	$ sh reproduceBug.sh

Using GDB to figure out what went wrong
	$ gdb /u/eng/class/classesh/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls
	(gdb) info functions
	in ls.c:
		static void sort_files(void);
	The way ls is sorting the files, hence how it's listing them, is the buggy behavior, so I suspect
	the problem is here. 
	(gdb)	b sort_files
	(gdb) r -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
		Breakpoint 1 at 0x4040d0: file ls.c, line 2954.

(gdb) p compare_mtime
	$6 = {int (V, V)} 0x4064c0 <compare_mtime>
(gdb) q
	function compare_mtime looks suspicious... so I set a breakpoint here. 


	$ gdb /u/eng/class/classesh/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls

	This number is illogical, which hints at the possibility of integer overflow. 
	This occurs in timespec.h. 
To fix timespec.h
	$ cd coreutils-with-bug
	$ cd lib
	$ cp timespec.h newtimespec.h 
	$ mv newtimespec.h ~/timespec.h
	$ vim timespec.h
timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
{
if(a.tv_sec > b.tv_sec) {     
        return 1;
        }
  if(a.tv_sec < b.tv_sec) {
        return -1;
        }
  else {
        if (a.tv_nsec > b.tv_nsec) {
                return 1;
        }
        if(a.tv_nsec < b.tv_nsec) {
                return -1;
        }
        else
                return 0;
        }

Construct patch file lab4.diff containing coreutils fixes, 
in the form of a ChangeLog entry followed by a diff -u patch. 
	$ diff -u coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h timespec.h > lab4.diff
	To create ChangeLog entry, 
	$ emacs
	C-x 4 a
	"This patch corrects timespec.h in coreutils, preventing overflow by bypassing evaluation
        and instead returning positive, negative, or a value of zero for comparison result."
	C-x C-c
	$ cat lab4.diff >> ChangeLog
	$ mv ChangeLog lab4.diff
Checking if patch works! 
	$ cd coreutils-with-bug
        $ cd lib 
        $ rm timespec.h
        $ mv ~/timespec.h ~/coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h
        $ cd ..

	Patch works! :) 
Reproducing problem on SEASnet Linux servers home directory,
using the already-installed touch and ls 
utilities instead of the old version of coreutils
	$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
	$ ls -lt 
	-rw-r--r--   1 classesh class       0 Dec 17  2054 wwi-armistice 
	 Also buggy! 
Q: How well does SEASnet do?
	SEASnet was also buggy, making old files to appear like they are in the future. 
	The above command demonstrates this, as the touch command set the year as 1918, 
	but SEASnet lists the last modified date in 2054.
	This has to do with how the SEASnet servers represent years on the bit-representaion 
	level.
